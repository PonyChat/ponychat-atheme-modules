Help for SET FLOOD:

SET FLOOD configures ChanServ flood control settings. Flood
control uses two parameters: penalty, and maximum. Every user
in a channel has a score. The maximum parameter determines
the maximum score a user can have. Each time a user speaks,
the penalty is taken away from their score, and the time since
their last message is added. A user's score is maximised when
first speaking since joining. If the score drops below zero,
the configured action is executed. The action parameter can
be KICK, KICKBAN, or QUIET (if your IRCD supports it).

Flood control can be turned off using the OFF subcommand.

Syntax: SET <#channel> FLOOD <action> <penalty> <maximum>
Syntax: SET <#channel> FLOOD OFF

Examples:
    /msg &nick& SET #channel FLOOD kick 2 8
    /msg &nick& SET #silence FLOOD kickban 10 11
    /msg &nick& SET #coders FLOOD OFF
