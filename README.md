# PonyChat Atheme Modules

PonyChat maintains several custom Atheme modules. These are largely useless and
full of hacks, but we wanted to have them visible regardless. Use at your own
risk.

## cs_flood

Our custom antiflood module. It is configured by using ChanServ SET FLOOD.

## cs_poni

Ping, but with poni.

## cs_ponies

Allows operators to manage the list of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic
episodes listed in the services database, users to see the countdown until the
next episode of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic airs, and a SHUFFLE command
to allow users to randomly pick an episode of My Little Pony: Friendship is
Magic to watch.

## ponychat-ircd

An Atheme protocol module for our ircd [ponychat-ircd]
(http://github.com/PonyChat/ponychat-ircd) that supports our channel owner mode.
